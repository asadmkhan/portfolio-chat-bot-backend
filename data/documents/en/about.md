# About Asad

I’m Asad Khan, a senior full‑stack developer and software architect with more than 13 years of industry experience. I’ve spent my career building large‑scale web, desktop and cloud applications that solve real business problems for companies across Germany, the UAE and Pakistan.

I specialise in combining modern frontend frameworks (Angular, React, Vue.js) with robust backends powered by .NET 8/9, Node.js and Python. My work often involves integrating complex enterprise systems like SAP Business One through its Service Layer and HANA databases, as well as incorporating AI capabilities such as retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) chatbots and analytics.

Over the years I’ve architected multi‑tenant platforms, optimised performance with caching and background workers, and implemented DevOps practices using Docker, Kubernetes and Azure DevOps. I’m passionate about automation, having built dozens of tools with Selenium, and I enjoy mentoring teams on clean architecture, scalable design and applied AI.

When I’m not coding you’ll find me exploring system design ideas, contributing to open‑source projects and sharing knowledge about building production‑ready AI systems. I’m currently based in Ingolstadt, Germany and open to full‑time, freelance or consulting opportunities worldwide.
